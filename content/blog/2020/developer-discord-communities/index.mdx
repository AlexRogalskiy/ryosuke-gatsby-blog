Recently it's seemed that a lot of developer communities are moving over to Discord from the myriad of dispersed platforms (like Github issues, Slack, or message boards like Spectrum). Discord has been a great way to connect with other developers across the world on the instanenous level only real-time chat can provide. There's nothing like having a problem, going to the **#help** chat, and getting 4+ insightful responses right away. It's also nice to have the option to spin up a voice or video chat with fellow devs and work out a problem together.

Here's a list of developer Discord communities that I've discovered and joined over time.
