Kush Supply Co. approached me prior to 4/20, during the launch of one of their new products, to design a newsletter to accompany their marketing campaign. The marketing team provided the copy, I designed the newsletter. After a few rounds of revisions and critiques, I sliced the newsletter up for the team to compose and send out.
