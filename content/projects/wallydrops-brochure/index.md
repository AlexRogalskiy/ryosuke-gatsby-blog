WallyDrops, a medical cannabis edible manufacturer, approached me to product a new brochure to advertise their product catalog on a B2B level. They requested a design for a trifold that included their entire product catalog, prices, and eye-catching images. Each product was photographed, as well as group shots for promotional use. And the brochure was designed in Illustrator, and the client was provided a working template to alter text to their preference.
