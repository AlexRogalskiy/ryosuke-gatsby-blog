In an effort to educate customers on the variety of vape services offered, Kush Supply Co contracted me to create various graphics for social media that illustate their offerings.

I used a pre-existing illustration library as the basis for the humans and created custom elements that branded them appropriately.

And of course, any and all vaporizer and more custom objects were illustrated from scratch.
